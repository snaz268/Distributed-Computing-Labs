Lab 5: TCP Based Data Dictionary
Problem Description
Using client-server architecture, design and implement a multi-threaded TCP server that allows concurrent clients to search the meaning(s) of a word, add a new word, and remove an existing word. This task has been designed to demonstrate the use of two fundamental technologies:
•	Sockets
•	Threads
Hence, the task must make an EXPLICIT use of the two above. 
Architecture
•	The system will follow a client-server architecture in which multiple clients can connect to a (single) multi-threaded server and perform operations concurrently.
•	The multi-threaded server may implement a thread-per-request, thread-per-connection, or worker pool architecture. This is a design decision for you to make.
Interaction
•	All communication will take place via TCP sockets. 
•	You are responsible for designing your own message exchange protocol. Some data formats that you may use include XML, JSON, Java Object Serialization, or you may choose to design your own.

Functional Requirements
Query the meaning(s) of a given word
The client should implement a function that is used to query the dictionary with the following minimum (additional input/output parameters can be used as required) input and output:
•	Input: Word to search
•	Output: Meaning(s) of the word
•	Error: The server should clearly indicate if the word was not found or if an error occurred. In  case of an error, a suitable description of the error should be given to the user

Add a new word
Add a new word and one or more of its meanings to the dictionary. For the word to be added successfully it should not exist already in the dictionary. Also, attempting to add a word without an associated meaning should result in an error. A new word added by one client should be visible to all other clients of the dictionary server. The minimum input and output parameters are as follows:
•	Input: Word to add, meaning(s)
•	Output: Status of the operation (e.g., success, duplicate)
•	Error: The user should be informed if any errors occurred while performing the operation.

Remove an existing word
Remove a word and all of its associated meanings from the dictionary. A word deleted by one client should not be visible to any of the clients of the dictionary server. If the word does not exist in the dictionary then no action should be taken. The minimum input and output parameters are as follows:
•	Input: Word to remove
•	Output: Status of the operation (e.g., success, not found)
•	Error: The user should be informed if any errors occurred while performing the operation.
